# Unit 20: React Week 2

## Overview
In this unit, we will work with complex state management techniques. We will use a combination of React Hooks and the Context API to create a state management flow similar to Redux.

## Key Topics
* React Hooks
* The Context API
* Store
* Reducers
* Effects
* Redux design patterns 

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What conditions must be met when creating React Hooks?
2. At a high level, how does the Context API reduce "prop-drilling"?
3. How does one manage state in a complex application?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Utilize React's most common built-in Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.
* Transform a React application that manages state with a class component into an application that uses functional components with React Hooks.
* Utilize a combination of Context Objects, Providers, and consumers via the `useContext` Hook to manage global state.
* Transform an app that manages state in Container components into one that follows a Redux pattern.
* Identify the appropriate time to make a React app use Redux or follow a similar design pattern.
* Implement a Redux-like store in a React app.

## Homework: Portfolio
* Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, you'll be updating your portfolio and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.
